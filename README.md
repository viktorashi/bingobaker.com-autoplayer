```
for the operation and options

## Regarding  all the options : if nothing is specified, the last used value from the bingoconfig.json file will be used, if never specified before, the default values will be used

### <font size=5> Positional arguments</font> reffer to the first thing you type after ```python autobingo.py```, meaning the function you want to execute, generating, checking the bingos, marking the spots (which includes checking the bingo's if any spots containing the keywords have been found), and clearing the cards in case jack got a bigo already :'( 
    
- generate : generates {--count} bingo cards from the specified {--url}, writes their links to {--cards [default cards.txt]} (middle free space is always checked)
- check :checks bingos for each card, will be less used since it automatically checks the bingo eitherway for each card as it searches
- editconfig : is the default behaviour if nothing specified, it does nothing but update the ***bingoconfig.json***

### <font size=5> --accelleration <sub> [default: 7 , shorthand -acc]</sub> </font>: The number of threads to use for speeding it up, careful: too many and it's won't really work that well, I suggest around 10-15 the max, it's plenty fast eitherway

### <font size=5> --url <sub>[default:"" nothing, only paramter that needs specified, shorthand -u]</sub></font>: the link to the bingobaker.com generator 

### <font size=5> --count <sub>[default: 100, shorthand -cnt]</sub></font> : number of cards to be generated by the {generate} function 


### <font size=5> --gamemode <sub>[default : normal , shorthand -gm] </sub> </font>: The bingo shape for the code to check
options:
 - norrmal : full row, collumn or diagonal
 - blackout : all spots
 - peen : form of a peepee ╭ᑎ╮ middle collumn bottom row
 - 3in6 : 3x3 square inside 6x6 grid
 - loser : shape of an L on her forehead (first collumn, last row)
 - 4corners : 4 corners of the card
- X (or x): X shape
- plus : + shape

### <font size=5> --reverse <sub>[Bool, default: False, shorthand -r] </sub> </font>: Wether  to do all operations on cards in reverse or normal order, usage: 
```bash
python autobingo.py mark -r
```
or 
```bash
python autobingo.py mark --reverse
```


### <font size=5> --start <sub>[int, default: 0, shorthard -strt] </sub> </font>:  The index of the card to start doing anything from

### <font size=5> --free-space <sub>[string, default: "no credit", shorthand -fs] </sub> </font>: The name of the freespace spot to check for if the card has an even size (meaning there is no clear midde spot)

### <font size=5> --input <sub> [default: input.txt , shorthand -i]</sub> </font>  is the file in which you have the keywords you want to search for on the bingo cards, each keyword on a new line. They DON'T have to be specified exactly as in the cards, lowercase values will be compared and they can just contain  those strings

<h3><span style="color:#F47174"> 3. It will all be saved  </span></h3>


### Every parameter value you provide to the command will be saved in a file called ***bingoconfig.json*** right next to the program. Plus it will automatically check set the size to the card's size, if the free space is in the middle or not and update that in the config file. Found bingo's are automatically clicked as well<h3><span style="color:red"> DO NOT CHANGE THE CONFIG FILE DIRECTLY</span></h3>



<img src="image.png" alt="drawing" width="70">   <font size=40> Warning: </font> 

idk how well i've tested this but i believe it starts messing up if you do. But delete it all-togather if you have and it doesn't work anymore, it will just generate another one.

<h1>Usage example</h1>

#### Don't be scared by the extensive docs, it's actually really easy to use
First you would usually want to generate the cards, so 
##### **`zsh`**
```bash
python autobingo.py generate --url https://bingobaker.com/#64c998520e68afc5 -cnt 100
```
should do the job, then you would create an **input.txt** right next to this and run

##### **`zsh`**
```bash
python autobingo.py check
```
ez, peek into the console once in a while and see if it outputed anything about a congratilations, then go to output.json to check it.
#### This generates 75 bingo cards with the generator link you have provided to it, the bingo's of which will be saved to the ***wins.txt*** file.

##### **`zsh`**
```bash
python autobingo.py generate --url https://bingobaker.com/#64c998520e68afc5 --output wins.txt --count 75 
```
Given all this data has been saved to ***bingoconfig.json*** this 


<h2>For the coders</h2>
There's also a class you can use in your projects by doing

```python
from main import autobingo
```

at the top of your adjecent python file
